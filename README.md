This repository contains my submission for the DT Fellowship Simulation Assignment, Option 3 – Content Creator | Interior Design. The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate structured content creation and analysis for an online aggregator in the construction and interior design ecosystem.

Key highlights:

Prompt Engineering: Designed content prompts using AIDCA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Conviction → Action) and tagged relevant Cialdini persuasion principles.

Message–Market Resonance Analysis: Evaluated mock campaign metrics (views and CTR) to identify misfits and optimize content prompts.

Strategic Summary: Reflected on lessons learned, iteration mindset, and content engineering best practices.

AI Usage: AI tools were used as co-pilots for formatting and refining content, following DT’s guidelines. All final wording and reasoning represent my personal understanding and judgment.

This repository serves as a complete demonstration of disciplined prompt design, data-driven messaging, and reflective strategy for building persuasive and effective content at scale.
